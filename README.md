Smart Door Lock System using Arduino Uno

Designed and implemented a password-based smart door lock with PIR motion detection for enhanced security. The system uses a 4×4 keypad for authentication, an I2C LCD for user guidance, and a servo motor for automatic locking/unlocking. It also includes LED and buzzer alerts for unauthorized access attempts.
